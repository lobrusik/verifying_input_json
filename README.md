A method that verifies the input JSON data. The input JSON is read from a file.
# How to run
1. In the **dist** folder, run the **method_json.exe** application.
2. To see the code, and then run it, you need to open **method_json.py** in the appropriate development environment, and then run it (in PyCharm just press Shift + F10)
3. We run the test similarly, using **test_method_json**
